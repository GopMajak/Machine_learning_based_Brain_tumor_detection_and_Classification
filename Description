CNN-Based Brain Tumor Detection Project Description.......................................................................................................................

This project focuses on developing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to detect and classify brain tumors from medical imaging data, such as MRI scans. 
The primary goal is to create an automated, accurate, and efficient diagnostic tool that assists healthcare professionals in identifying and 
categorizing brain tumors into distinct types, such as gliomas, meningiomas, or pituitary, and nontumor.

Tasks:
Developed and implemented a machine learning model for brain tumor detection and classification using MRI data, 
improving diagnostic accuracy and the identification of glioma, meningioma, pituitary, and non-tumor scans

Applied feature engineering and data preprocessing techniques to enhance model performance, including normalization, 
dimensionality reduction, and image segmentation for better tumor classification.

Explored various machine learning algorithms and hyperparameter tuning strategies to optimize model performance, 
ensuring efficient and accurate classification of brain tumors from MRI data
